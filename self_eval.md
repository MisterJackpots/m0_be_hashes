# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

I found this section to be straightforward and understandable, and enjoyed
using the each method and conditionals in conjunction with hashes to complete
the last problem in hashes_2.rb.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I was never a very good note taker in high school or college, so it has been an
uphill battle.  That said, the "Before Mod0" section on notetaking has been a
great guide for someone like me, and I am doing my best to emulate the style
and techniques.  My best notetaking happened during the pre-recorded video lesson
with Amy, in part because I could go back and re-visit things she said.  I also do
well on the lessons we complete independently outside of live sessions.  Definitely
thinking ahead about the best method to take notes for all the future live sessions,
since I know we have a ton of those coming up!

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

My first instinct is to review my notes on the lesson and study the code itself
to see if I can figure it.  That process has been *pretty* successful so far, but
I have gone to the Google machine on occasion when I am truly stumped.
